## Quick Notes/Overview

There's not really much to be said about this project, other than the fact that it was a pretty good way to get myself to learn Tailwind CSS. Moving forward, I'd like to get more familiar with Tailwind, so I might come to back to this project to refactor some code and clean it up a bit more.

## Tech Stack
- React, bootstrapped with CRA
- Fontsource to self-host fonts instead of using Google Fonts' CDN
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Hosted on Vercel
